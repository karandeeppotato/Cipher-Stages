# Cipher-Stages
Some of the known Ciphers .... everything coded in C++

1) The Ceaser Shift

    Named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encode his military messages, 
    the Caesar shift is as simple as a cipher gets. 
    All you have to do is substitute each letter in the alphabet by shifting it right or left by a specific number of letters. 
    Today, we can break this code in our sleep, 
    but it took ancient codebreakers 800 years to learn how to crack it - and nearly another 800 years to come up with anything better.

2) Alberti's Disk
     
     In 1467, architect Leon Battista Alberti described a curious device. It was a disk made up of two concentric rings: the outer ring engraved with a standard alphabet, and the inner ring, engraved with the same alphabet but written out of order. By rotating the inner ring and matching letters across the disk, a message could be enciphered, one letter at a time, in a fiendishly complex way.
